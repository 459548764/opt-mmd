This does the GAN training.

Code (mostly) by Hsiao-Yu Tung; feel free to contact her at sfish0101@gmail.com
if you have any questions.

## Basic Usage:

First download the mnist files: `data/mnist/fetch.sh`

- The original MMD generative model:

    bash run_mmd.sh


- The model maximizing the MMD/variance t-statistic:

    bash run_tmmd.sh

- MMD generative model with adversarially optimized kernel function using GAN
loss:

    bash run_mmd_fm.sh


Visualize the results with tensorboard:

    tensorboard --logdir=logs_mmd --port=1234
